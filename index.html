          Todo react app -app which allows users to effortlessly add, edit, and
          delete tasks, helping them stay organized and on top of their to-do
          lists. With a focus on performance and user experience, the app
          leverages Vite's fast build times and React's component-based
          architecture to deliver a smooth and efficient workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d Portfolio - similar to this Portfolio I worked on another page in
          which I used several React parallax models to generate a fun
          interactive page
        </p>
        <p>
          Dynamic-dashbord - application built with React. It allows users to
          manage and interact with widgets in various categories. The
          application features the ability to add, remove, and search through
          widgets, as well as the option to include images in widgets. It also
          includes a sidebar for easy navigation.

        <h2>üèÜ Btech Projects</h2>

        <p>
          Developed a cutting-edge machine learning project focused on
          predicting Parkinson`s disease using Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)
          neural networks applied to voice input datasets. Developed using
          TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn .Pandas, NumPy,LibROSA (for audio
          processing)
